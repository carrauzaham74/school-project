<?php
// Example PHP code

// This is just an example of how you might write some basic PHP code.
// You can replace this with actual code as needed.

// Example: Adding a statement to output a message
echo "This is my PHP code in school-project.";

// Or, if you have a database or another data source in mind:
// $sql = "SELECT * FROM your_table_name";
?>
